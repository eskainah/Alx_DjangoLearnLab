#####               An Event Management API
#####An ALX Backend Development Capstone Project by Edwin Saah Kainah

Events bring people together and create shared experiences, whether social, cultural, religious, educational, or commercial. They vary in size from small gatherings like dinner parties to large global summits. An event is a planned happening that takes place at a specific time and location, either as a one-time event or a recurring gathering. Effective event planning is essential for a successful event. Detailed planning is necessary to meet requirements, stay within budget, and ensure the right equipment is available. This process is time-consuming and requires effort, highlighting the importance of event management. It involves delivering a creative vision to achieve a successful final outcome. 

An event's success relies on the coordination of many small tasks, all guided by a plan. Event management is made easier with the use of event management software, a digital tool that streamlines planning, organization, and execution. This software includes features like event registration, ticketing, venue selection, scheduling, attendee engagement, and post-event analysis. By utilizing event management software, organizers can simplify tasks, manage logistics more efficiently, communicate with participants, and analyze data to improve future events. The software also provides a centralized platform for coordination, reducing manual efforts and increasing precision, ultimately enhancing the overall success and efficiency of events. This event management API offers key features to ensure smooth event execution.

Project Planning
The project will be divided into multiple phases, from gathering requirements to deployment. Here's an overview of the project plan:

a. Requirement Gathering
    *Understanding user roles (admin, event organizer, attendees).
    *Defining essential features: event creation, event categories, attendee management, user registration for event, comments and notification.
    *Identifying security needs such as authentication.

b. Technology Stack
    *Backend: Django Rest Framework (DRF) for API development.
    *Database: MySQL for reliable relational data management.
    *Authentication: Django built-in authentication.
    *Third-Party APIs: Google calendar.
    *Deployment: PythonAnywhere or Heroku for hosting the API 
    *Version Control: Git and GitHub/GitLab for code management.

c. Development Timeline
    *Week 1: Project setup, version control, API design, prototyping, implementation and testing.
    *Week 2: Advanced features, error handling, testing, optimization and deployment
